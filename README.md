# Personal Portfolio Website

This is a **portfolio website** built entirely in **Flutter** to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences in software development, cloud engineering, and UI/UX design. The site features a unique dark mode design and interactive elements, highlighting a modern and engaging user experience.



## Why Flutter?

Flutter was chosen to build this project to demonstrate its ability to create visually compelling, responsive web applications. Despite being primarily a mobile framework, Flutter proves to be a robust tool for building modern websites with unique design requirements.

## Design Reference

The design for this portfolio was prototyped using Figma. Check out the design here: [Figma Design Link](https://www.figma.com/design/UeixAHUPLTSKiwHR9HVfT2/Portfolio?node-id=0-1&t=QkxcB16bQkJ96mpv-1).
